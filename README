Intro:
------

These scripts are little helpers for logrotate to produce reports. Each report
prints out all spam rules that have been in use by spamassassin and rspamd. The
reports are devided into ham and spam sections, each sorted by score (you can
change this in the scripts header).

There are some requirements that must be done before these scripts work. First
of all, amavisd-new must use a special log template and second rspamd must log
to syslog (I did not test a regular file. Maybe it does not have this
requirement).

For both, a working regular expression pattern has been defined in the scripts
headers. If the scripts do not generate the reports, then you might need to
tweak the matching rules.


logrotate:
----------

My logrotate script looks something like this:

/var/log/mail.log
{
        rotate 14
        daily
        missingok
        notifempty
        compress
        compresscmd /usr/bin/pbzip2
        compressoptions -9
        compressext .bz2
        dateext
        delaycompress
        sharedscripts
        postrotate
                DATE=$(date +"%Y%m%d")

                /usr/local/sbin/create-spamassassin-report.py \
                        < /var/log/mail.log-${DATE} | \
                        mail -s "Report: spamassassin" root

                /usr/bin/rspamadm configdump -j | \
                        /usr/local/sbin/create-rspamd-report.py \
                                /var/log/mail.log-${DATE} | \
                        mail -s "Report: rspamd" root

                kill -HUP $(cat /run/rsyslogd.pid) &>/dev/null || true
        endscript
}

This example combines statistics for spamassassin and rspamd, if both are logged
to syslog.

This usage guarentees that you will get a full 24 hour report. I have placed the
two scripts under /usr/local/sbin. If you prefer another place, you must adpot
the paths in the logrotate snippet. Note: If you use a separate log file for
rspamd, it might look like this:

/var/log/rspamd/rspamd.log{
       daily
       rotate 4
       delaycompress
       compress
       notifempty
       missingok
       postrotate
          DATE=$(date +"%Y%m%d")
          /usr/bin/rspamadm configdump -j | \
                /usr/local/sbin/create-rspamd-report.py \
                        /var/log/rspamd/rspamd.log-${DATE} | \
                mail -s "Report: rspamd" root
          test -r /run/rspamd/rspamd.pid && kill -USR1 $(cat /run/rspamd/rspamd.pid) &>/dev/null
       endscript
}

As of writing this document, HUP is broken in rspamd. You must call USR1 for log
rotation!


General requirements:
---------------------

A python 2.x interpreter. Maybe python 3 does also work, but I did not try it
yet.


Requirements for amavisd-new:
-----------------------------

I have copied template code directly out of amavisd and have slithly modified
it:

# template derived from /usr/sbin/amavisd ~ line 33886
$log_recip_templ = '

]';

This will produce log lines similar to that (wrapped for better reading):

Requirements for rspamd:
------------------------

Only if you want to have rspamd log to syslog, follow these extra steps!

I personally like to have mail related logging at one place and not devided into
several different files. For that I have told rspamd to log into syslog by
override statement:

rspamd.conf.override:

logging {
    type = "syslog";
    facility = "mail";
    level = "info";
    .include "$CONFDIR/logging.inc"
}

This will produce log lines similar like this (wrapped for better reading)::

Jul 20 08:50:43 mx rspamd[12384]: <5c3ffd>; task; rspamd_task_write_log: id:
<...>, qid: <3rvSGm6s5gzGpVW>, ip:
..., from: <...>,
(default: T (reject): [22.79/15.00]
[DBL_SPAM,MIME_GOOD,URIBL_BLACK,RBL_SPAMHAUS_SBL,FORGED_SENDER,RBL_SPAMHAUS_CSS,FORGED_MUA_THUNDERBIRD_MSGID_UNKNOWN,BAYES_SPAM]),
len: 2045, time: 15.999ms real, 7.253ms virtual, dns req: 30

If you prefer not to let rspamd log to syslog and you want to stay with the
default rspamd.log file, you need to call the stats script in another logrotate
script similar to this:

Have fun...
